### Install Rolltables

Open the `Augmented Reality Rolltables` compendium and copy the folders to the `Rollable Tables` tab.

Macros for the kit can be found in the `Augmented Reality Macros` compendium. Drag and drop any you need into the macro toolbar. Macros use the current `Roll Mode` when executed.

### Ironsworn/Starforged Tip - Use Custom Folders to add Character Sheet Oracles

* Use this method to add the Augmented Reality kit.
* If it does not already exist, create a `Custom Oracles` folder in `Rollable Tables` tab called:
  * `Custom Oracles` - EN
  * `Oráculos personalizados` - ES
  * `Oracles personnalisés` - FR
  * `Własne Wyrocznie` - PL
  * `Свои оракулы` - RU

Open the `Augmented Reality Rolltables` compendium and copy the folders into the `Rollable Tables` `Custom Oracles` folder.

![Rollable Tables - Custom Oracles](https://github.com/jendave/augmented-reality-foundry/blob/main/docs/custom-oracles-rollable-tables.jpg?raw=true)

The Oracles will be available in the Character sheet under `Custom Oracles`.
